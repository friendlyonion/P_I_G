- Recruitment will be tracked by averaging the daily increase/decrease of residents. **This means the competition is based on your daily increase of residents, not just total**. 
- 1st Prize will be **75G**, 2nd Prize will be **50G**, and 3rd Prize will be **30G**. 
- If you need help learning how to recruit LMK! 

Mayors: **__in order for your town to participate, please react with a üèòÔ∏è to this message!__**
wrestlingwithgod#0 I know it exists
wrestlingwithgod#0 Still haven‚Äôt found a cascadia head
estiqt#0 i see
wrestlingwithgod#0 All flag heads should sell for 20g plus minimum cause they are harder and harder to pull as more heads get added to mystery crates
estiqt#0 these are heads btw
estiqt#0 is any of this worth it
estiqt#0 yukon 20g @ patagonia

DaCorgoKing#3318 (he prob thought I was some random resident)
DaCorgoKing#3318 Talked to tavi actually
sayerqt#0 and Russian nations are being poached by the NSR
sayerqt#0 Tfw NSR nations are being poached by Russia
estiqt#0 we'll buy it back
estiqt#0 umatilla left
sayerqt#0 ok
wrestlingwithgod#0 I set the gold up for towns in n spawn you can distribute this without me and its already documented on bank history
wrestlingwithgod#0 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130310621167091712/1136432543604932740/2023-08-02_15.40.28.pngmilgorn123#0 Yeah I know my bad
sayerqt#0 Because it‚Äôs 30 not 50
sayerqt#0 Should have checked the budget
wrestlingwithgod#0 üíÄ
milgorn123#0 Yeah I wasn‚Äôt even going to but moggs asked twice and said wrest said I could or something
wrestlingwithgod#0 Scammer get scammed
milgorn123#0 I have no clue where the thirty came from
milgorn123#0 I gave mogs 50G cause she said it was how much her department was allocated btw
sayerqt#0 interesting
wrestlingwithgod#0 fyi
wrestlingwithgod#0 just fyu
wrestlingwithgod#0 im fix the bank history but 50g is unaccounted for
wrestlingwithgod#0 min
wrestlingwithgod#0 give me a wis
sayerqt#0 This is wrests job and you can‚Äôt even argue you‚Äôre making it more efficient because you‚Äôre doing his job wrong
sayerqt#0 <@841159381495578674> Can you stop violating the law
wrestlingwithgod#0 im lose my mind
wrestlingwithgod#0 so milgorn pulled 80g out gave 50 to mogs and kept 30
sayerqt#0 just fyi
sayerqt#0 it‚Äôs 30g now
sayerqt#0 it changes each budget
sayerqt#0 that was their initial budget in the act that established it
sayerqt#0 <@127917011840925696> NPS doesn‚Äôt have a 50g budget
estiqt#0 their nation sunk 1500 gold into it, and I‚Äôll be damned if I let them get more out of it
estiqt#0 but yeah, he has absolutely no one else to turn to and I really don‚Äôt think he understands that to be honest, we can just wait them out
estiqt#0 and I assume you already ask for the 500 gold
estiqt#0 it doesn‚Äôt matter that much
estiqt#0 oh, because if it‚Äôs slightly less than 1000, we could ask for 50% of the chunk price
estiqt#0 can you determine exactly how much gold was used to claim the city of Walla Walla?
estiqt#0 <@841159381495578674>
estiqt#0 ye
milgorn123#0 And if he deletes it he‚Äôs wasting everyone‚Äôs money
milgorn123#0 Like the town is surrounded by other towns
milgorn123#0 He has no better option so I‚Äôll just tell him to take 500 or leave it
milgorn123#0 Pico is asking for 2.5k lmfao
estiqt#0 i see
DaCorgoKing#3318 Also dude's ign is Oya3rdLight
DaCorgoKing#3318 so I'm not sure if it's gonna happen
DaCorgoKing#3318 Kloton's trying to pass it down to some dude named luigi though
DaCorgoKing#3318 and I got a friend that's wanting to snipe it
estiqt#0 ah
DaCorgoKing#3318 It's actually Kloton's nation right now, but he appears to be quitting
estiqt#0 ‚Ä¶?
DaCorgoKing#3318 Nord
sayerqt#0 whi
estiqt#0 that being?
DaCorgoKing#3318 We might just get a friendly nation in the arctic empire
estiqt#0 then they will be forced to cooperate
estiqt#0 all we have to do is secure umatilla and make a border
estiqt#0 if we break off ties with jefferson, they‚Äôll align with our enemies like indochina
estiqt#0 we can always mine more gold
estiqt#0 but this is our best course of action
estiqt#0 and yes i know it‚Äôs a shitty fucking move jefferson‚Äôs doing
estiqt#0 and again, we‚Äôre gonna make borders with them, which will make sure they can‚Äôt steal our towns anymore
estiqt#0 i made it known that cascadia wouldn‚Äôt pay more than 50% of claimcost
estiqt#0 which is why i‚Äôm paying 192g from my own pockets
estiqt#0 408g max
estiqt#0 is it worth 600g? absolutely not
estiqt#0 and tbf he did rebuild a lot of the old city
estiqt#0 yeah ^
sayerqt#0 still think he should let us have it
sayerqt#0 just wanted to clarify that it's not like a cascadian spent all of the gold to claim it
sayerqt#0 but it ain't great
sayerqt#0 Like it was a cascadian town that fell, and he remade
sayerqt#0 To be entirely fair, forest himself paid out of his own pocket to claim all of it
wrestlingwithgod#0 Ridiculous to keep saying they are friendly or good to us but they are straight scamming gold from us using our own town and have poached and likely to continue poaching
wrestlingwithgod#0 That‚Äôs whatever just next election Jefferson is gonna be a talking point whether we should remain allys or not at this point
wrestlingwithgod#0 So either way forest is scamming cascadians
estiqt#0 The city is important enough that I think this move was necessary
estiqt#0 it equals out to about 75% of total claim cost, which, well, not ideal, cascadia only has to pay the 50% claim cost while i cover the other 25%
estiqt#0 however, because it‚Äôs an important city, and 42Forest would not give the city up for 400 gold, the only way I could guarantee a transfer was to get Cascadia to pay 408 gold while I cover the last 192 from my own bank
estiqt#0 The city is worth just over 820 gold, typically it would be sold for 25 to 50% of the cost of claiming every chunk
estiqt#0 By the way, about the city of umatilla
milgorn123#0 Yeah
estiqt#0 either way we win :)
estiqt#0 lol
estiqt#0 we just ban the alt
estiqt#0 and hey, if they end up not recruiting
estiqt#0 and when they recruit, we get one of our people (that has no history on the server) to join the town, then when they get banned it becomes a cascadian town
estiqt#0 we let them make a town
estiqt#0 i have a MUCH BETTER IDEA
estiqt#0 wait
estiqt#0 wait
estiqt#0 orw
estiqt#0 let's wait for them to make an alt then ban the alt :)
estiqt#0 yea
estiqt#0 okay
estiqt#0 oh he already was banned? good
estiqt#0 overall a W
estiqt#0 and it cost them like 32g or whatever to reclaim
estiqt#0 for a while though it was deleted, i assume a lot of stuff was stolen already which is good
estiqt#0 damn Arsburg got reclaimed
estiqt#0 alright let's make sure not to let them know that we know
estiqt#0 ok this is good
.bachinuni#0 My mans doesn't even try to hide it
.bachinuni#0 Bruhh
sayerqt#0 fr
DaCorgoKing#3318 they're killing themselves
DaCorgoKing#3318 lmfao
milgorn123#0 I'm hoping he creates an alt account so we can get it banned
milgorn123#0 5set was banned for alting
milgorn123#0 wait
milgorn123#0 Just don't say anything to him yet we can use this to our advantage

estiqt#0 the town falling made them lose 528g
estiqt#0 banff
estiqt#0 south of uh
estiqt#0 RMF town
estiqt#0 seemingly deleted?
estiqt#0 Arsburg fell
estiqt#0 good news
estiqt#0 y'all
estiqt#0 fr tho the AU was always kinda dead
milgorn123#0 üíÄ
estiqt#0 because you don‚Äôt know anything /j
milgorn123#0 I was President during that time
milgorn123#0 Wait how did I not know this
milgorn123#0 Oh I see
sayerqt#0 and then we dissolved it
estiqt#0 ye
estiqt#0 oh that one
sayerqt#0 It failed because Mexico left during the grand canyon dispute
sayerqt#0 It was Cascadia, Midwest, and Mexico
sayerqt#0 The AU was an alliance like milgorn is suggesting, not a meganation
sayerqt#0 The USA was earlier than the AU
sayerqt#0 Both have existed in aurora and we have been apart of both
sayerqt#0 Yall are confusing the AU and the US
estiqt#0 and at that point it‚Äôs not the US anymore
DaCorgoKing#3318 I mean cascadia is already similar enough to the US irl that we simply dont need it
sayerqt#0 I'm talking about the AU
sayerqt#0 Milgorn
estiqt#0 or to only claim a few states within the actual union
milgorn123#0 Yeah
estiqt#0 The only way it can be done is to either get a ton of people in already existing nations to join, making it less centralized and more likely to dissolve over time due to political tensions
milgorn123#0 I wasn‚Äôt thinking an alliance, not a mega nation
milgorn123#0 That‚Äôs fair
estiqt#0 attempting to rule over such a large area is impossible.
milgorn123#0 I see
estiqt#0 there have been well over a dozen attempts at creating the United States. All have failed.
milgorn123#0 Okay but why
estiqt#0 it collapsed because every single American union always collapses
milgorn123#0 And the USA
milgorn123#0 What happened to the last AU
estiqt#0 all this will do is make several meganation‚Äôs enemies of the republic
milgorn123#0 Also
milgorn123#0 Fair enough
estiqt#0 but instead of making a new nation to counteract imperialist expansion, we need to resolve the issues that are currently facing our nation and our current allies
milgorn123#0 Just generally having alliances and agreements against it is good
milgorn123#0 Like
milgorn123#0 I mean yeah, we can
estiqt#0 it is very concerning
estiqt#0 I saw what they did to Minnesota
estiqt#0 either way, we do not need, nor can we particularly influence foreign nations colonizing North America
sayerqt#0 But they have Pennsylvania, Maine, and now are taking over a former Midwestern state
sayerqt#0 NSR is also being imperialist too to a less degree
sayerqt#0 If all their North American lands were just one meganation it'd be the 2nd largest entity in north america
estiqt#0 well, that sounds like is that they‚Äôre stretched way too thin, meaning that we can extend our influence into the northwest territories, Yukon, and northern British Columbia
sayerqt#0 and basically all of central america
sayerqt#0 A large part of the caribbean
estiqt#0 i see
sayerqt#0 They own Alaska basically all of northern canada, Florida, the entire southern US effectively
estiqt#0 the fuck
estiqt#0 what
sayerqt#0 Rus has like 60 meganations
milgorn123#0 oh wait my bad
estiqt#0 they only own like alaska right
milgorn123#0 Esti where have you been
milgorn123#0 we could make an alliance
sayerqt#0 Are you fr?
estiqt#0 the fuck
estiqt#0 where
estiqt#0 what
estiqt#0 there‚Äôs literally nothing we can do about it either way
sayerqt#0 Rus owns like a fourth of north america
sayerqt#0 Rus and the NSR are the biggest imperialist powers and are encroaching on the actual north american nations
estiqt#0 OK sure, Persia might own fucking West antarctic or whatever but that‚Äôs some bullshit that no one cares about
milgorn123#0 it's weird
milgorn123#0 Yeah there's a lot of foreign powers colonizing north america
sayerqt#0 North America is so fucking colonized
sayerqt#0 but that's just not true
sayerqt#0 i'm against the AU
sayerqt#0 that's a lukewarm take
milgorn123#0 what
sayerqt#0 esti
milgorn123#0 okay fair enough I wrote it while half asleep
estiqt#0 Milgorn there‚Äôs no fucking colonization on this goddamn earth Minecraft server
estiqt#0 There‚Äôs a reason NATO requires a unanimous vote in order for new member states to be admitted into the alliance
milgorn123#0 the idea is since colonization is bad the alliance would counter that
sayerqt#0 the AU was shit
sayerqt#0 because it didn't
sayerqt#0 it's a joke
sayerqt#0 I said "Wow, another American Union, that went great the firsst time
estiqt#0 also, a 2/3 super majority for inviting people and kicking them out of the nation? That is just calling for a ton of rivalry and conflict within the alliance.
milgorn123#0 ~~what~~
sayerqt#0 i was being sarcastic
sayerqt#0 milgorn
estiqt#0 what the fuck is the American union going to do? That the OFN isn‚Äôt already doing
estiqt#0 we already have a fucking alliance. It‚Äôs called the organization of free nations we don‚Äôt need another one.
milgorn123#0 More of an alliance
milgorn123#0 also read it it's not a meganation
milgorn123#0 why not
estiqt#0 what the FUCK is wrong with y‚Äôall
milgorn123#0 like
milgorn123#0 Literally why not try making another usa
milgorn123#0 nope :))
estiqt#0 is this a joke

milgorn123#0 and me and sayer make an organizational structure
milgorn123#0 We'd call it the American Union or something
milgorn123#0 Just a general triggerable defensive alliance
milgorn123#0 but like, less restricting but also not enough where people fuck with eachother
milgorn123#0 What are ya'lls thoughts on making the fifty seventh United States

wrestlingwithgod#0 bypassing their n spawn denial while still denying them access to cascadia n spawn
wrestlingwithgod#0 then we can join montana whenever to n spawn to kushan
wrestlingwithgod#0 make them ally montana

wrestlingwithgod#0 this is the same guy who would re declare war on us

milgorn123#0 I looked at the history it was in cascadia before that
milgorn123#0 "Joined nation 3 days ago"
Plunkten#4625 
milgorn123#0 <@&1001007207116193922> Jefferson poached the town of San Fernando
milgorn123#0 huh

estiqt#0 which is an acceptable loss, though regrettable
estiqt#0 we'll probably lose one or two very small cascadian cities
estiqt#0 woohooo
estiqt#0 in that case my prediction was wrong
estiqt#0 new saigon won't fall
estiqt#0 oh good news, esteban logged on today
estiqt#0 think
estiqt#0 we good i thin
estiqt#0 nvm
estiqt#0 the leader is in the fucking cascadian discord
estiqt#0 wait shit never mind
estiqt#0 it's 1 chunk, no one cares
estiqt#0 we don't have to worry about that town
estiqt#0 falls in 4 days
estiqt#0 sagebrush
estiqt#0 the other city in the northeast
estiqt#0 alright so
estiqt#0 irvine, hillcrest
estiqt#0 the southern part
estiqt#0 as well as like
estiqt#0 it'd be alright
estiqt#0 cut the northeast corner off
estiqt#0 i think that if we get them to like
estiqt#0 honestly, not a terrible map
estiqt#0 proposed map of jefferson's borders

DaCorgoKing#3318 the rmf is no more
DaCorgoKing#3318 well boys, we did it
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130310621167091712/1135463695447773195/image.pngravioli983#0 how do i get a litematica material list into tile format
ravioli983#0 one sec
estiqt#0 <@898022672317964308>
estiqt#0 ?
ravioli983#0 uhh
wrestlingwithgod#0 Although has been a few weeks sense we did an update from the mayors
estiqt#0 yeah
wrestlingwithgod#0 Cause these people are capable according to their mayor but are not mayors
estiqt#0 of course
wrestlingwithgod#0 Tbh <@301126967992909855> it‚Äôs useful in finding people actually interested in holding towns
estiqt#0 but ye
estiqt#0 tbh this probably isn‚Äôt practical
DaCorgoKing#3318 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130310621167091712/1135381580706226197/image.pngestiqt#0 what
DaCorgoKing#3318 might be a good way to get active mayors into towns we already have than to have them make a new one
DaCorgoKing#3318 it was made back in may though I dont think it was ever used
DaCorgoKing#3318 do we actually utilize the town inheritance thing?
milgorn123#0 I won't
estiqt#0 don‚Äôt mention hakai lodge
estiqt#0 and don‚Äôt state too much info
estiqt#0 don‚Äôt antagonize them
milgorn123#0 Good, good
milgorn123#0 Alrighty
estiqt#0 <@841159381495578674> read this first uh
estiqt#0 i‚Äôve been in contact with the mayor and they‚Äôve stated multiple times that they want to rejoin or have intentions of doing so
milgorn123#0 <@301126967992909855> How do you know Hakai Lodge is joiining
wrestlingwithgod#0 I think we should be trying to take advantage of the 80 claim bonus and try to claim the entire bioriegion and if we have some breakaways that‚Äôs fine they tend to eventually die or come back or are a smaller part of cascadia
wrestlingwithgod#0 Idk if this is a solveable problem as it‚Äôs anyone right to make a cascadian town anywhere within our border so it‚Äôs gonna be heard to dissuade them. Even trying directing players to select regions is difficult and the dedication to remain active to prevent 42 and the required leadership to keep people from falling behind is hard to come by in new players especially, if we stifle new players from making their own experimental towns.
estiqt#0 o7
estiqt#0 good luck mate
estiqt#0 christ
milgorn123#0 Good luck
milgorn123#0 Lmfao don‚Äôt worry about it
wrestlingwithgod#0 So sorry if I came a bit aggressive
wrestlingwithgod#0 I‚Äôm on page 6 of 12 page essay I need done by midnight and I have a stock market final that takes an hour
milgorn123#0 Like, the bio region and the Montana frontier
milgorn123#0 I mean let‚Äôs not make towns in the middle of nowhere and rather claim the main areas of Cascadia
milgorn123#0 Consolidate is the wrong word
ravioli983#0 build tall not wide
ravioli983#0 thst would make life way easier
ravioli983#0 yes
estiqt#0 not what i‚Äôm saying lmao
estiqt#0 what
wrestlingwithgod#0 Will you do /t delete and claim all of it over or do one chunk at a time?
wrestlingwithgod#0 Ok so when will Seattle join osoyoos
milgorn123#0 We have way too many
milgorn123#0 We need to consolidate our towns
milgorn123#0 EXACTLY
estiqt#0 <@&1001007207116193922>
estiqt#0 I hope that this finally brings cascadia to its senses
estiqt#0 this is been an ongoing issue for quite a while now
estiqt#0 The more cities we have, the less gold we can give to each one, the more likely it is for each individual city to break away
estiqt#0 this is why I said to reduce the number of single points of failure
estiqt#0 because we have too many cities to begin with, it makes it much easier for another nation to poach cities away from us
estiqt#0 I don‚Äôt want any more disaffected cities leaving us
estiqt#0 reach out to norcal cities and ask if there‚Äôs anything they would like to Cascadian government to do for them
milgorn123#0 ^^
estiqt#0 we are to establish borders and make it clear that no more of this is to be tolerated
milgorn123#0 Cut and clear poaching yeah
estiqt#0 Forest has admitted to be trying to recruit Cascadian cities in norcal to leave in favor of Jefferson
milgorn123#0 Okay so here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking
milgorn123#0 Yeah
estiqt#0 that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do here
estiqt#0 i know
milgorn123#0 Esti I understand where you are coming from but we need to draw a clear line that literally asking our towns to leave is not acceptable
milgorn123#0 Okay so a few things
milgorn123#0 What the hell did I miss
estiqt#0 alturas remains cascadian
estiqt#0 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130310621167091712/1135366413092130956/IMG_7814.pngestiqt#0 i‚Äôll see what I can do
estiqt#0 200g too high
estiqt#0 which is like
estiqt#0 but eventually, he said he‚Äôd be willing to sell it for 600 gold
estiqt#0 forest said that he does not want to sell umatilla because he already spent a lot of time restoring the city and all that
estiqt#0 okay, quick update before I go
sayerqt#0 alright cool
estiqt#0 and hakai lodge plans on rejoining cascadia
estiqt#0 in other news, any updates on this
estiqt#0 to work out any potential issues that might get in the way of this
estiqt#0 we have a group chat with milgorn and i, with forest and friendofmario
estiqt#0 just a heads up, the city of alturas plans on joining jefferson
milgorn123#0 Got the mayor to log on
milgorn123#0 Btw fox is safe
milgorn123#0 This all sounds good to me, yeah
estiqt#0 this build comp was planned out and executed very poorly
estiqt#0 and to have time to do so
estiqt#0 the whole point of a build comp is for people to build new stuff
estiqt#0 also deepslate
estiqt#0 go ahead
estiqt#0 mostly cobble
estiqt#0 if anyone wants dubs of building blocsk
estiqt#0 looted it
estiqt#0 nothing good
estiqt#0 new_AAlesund fell
estiqt#0 <@&1001006656303403058>
estiqt#0 if people raise concerns about the lack of gold i‚Äôll raise some donations in victoria
estiqt#0 the situation with umatilla is a net positive for both cascadia and jefferson
estiqt#0 basically what they did was hold the land so the RMF couldn‚Äôt get it
estiqt#0 this will maintain close relations, give us our city back, making it so that we only had to pay a fraction of what we might have had to pay otherwise to reclaim the city
estiqt#0 as the city fell and was reclaimed by an IRL friend of jefferson‚Äôs leader, i believe the best course of action is to request the city back, as the legitimate mayor has been found, and as a gesture of goodwill, give them some gold to compensate for the gold they lost claiming our city
sayerqt#0 sure
estiqt#0 as this is obviously changed, I believe this will change the future of the city as well
sayerqt#0 Relations are key with them
sayerqt#0 They've been consistently shitty to us and I don't usually like to criticize our allies
estiqt#0 The thing is, previously, we believed there was no one who had a claim to the city, nor was there anyone who could hold the city
sayerqt#0 I'm just voicing my opinion here
sayerqt#0 Yeah im not gonna fuck up relations
estiqt#0 alright?
estiqt#0 i will bring this up to forest
sayerqt#0 He claimed most of it
estiqt#0 sayer
sayerqt#0 He built all of it
sayerqt#0 Let holden get it
sayerqt#0 That's so shitty
sayerqt#0 Honestly im getting so pissed off with them imma be real
sayerqt#0 Bruhhhh
estiqt#0 and we'll just get it back in a border agreement
estiqt#0 but i think what's gonna happen is that it'll go to jefferson
estiqt#0 we can hope
estiqt#0 i mean, that's probably not gonna happen but alright
milgorn123#0 I see
sayerqt#0 to try to get the mayor role when the mayor is wiped
sayerqt#0 and he rejoined Umatilla County
sayerqt#0 Holden is back <@841159381495578674>
milgorn123#0 Me when I forget Arizona
estiqt#0 fox and yellowknife are the big ones
estiqt#0 .
sayerqt#0 also yellowknife
estiqt#0 <:jtp:1129155642905591969>
estiqt#0 AGAIN
estiqt#0 you forgot arizona
estiqt#0 a bunch of cascadian cities are not represented
estiqt#0 why the hell do you think
the same problems are still here
milgorn123#0 <@301126967992909855> why
milgorn123#0 Why
milgorn123#0 huh
estiqt#0 <@841159381495578674>
estiqt#0 stop that
estiqt#0 for the love of god
milgorn123#0 I'm going ot post this into the House of Reps btw
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130310621167091712/1134938114612265101/image.pngestiqt#0 understandable
milgorn123#0 I'll talk to their mayor
DaCorgoKing#3318 I can't speak for fox tho
DaCorgoKing#3318 new saigon might fall actually, I think Esteban quit, seeing as he left gc's he was in this morning
milgorn123#0 kk
estiqt#0 fox or new saigon
estiqt#0 please do not post that anywhere
milgorn123#0 Maybe we can get them to pay for the chunks that cross the border
milgorn123#0 Btw this was teh de facto border
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130310621167091712/1134911173767205025/image.pngmilgorn123#0 Idea for border with jefferson
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130310621167091712/1134910431325069512/image.pngmilgorn123#0 What town?
.bachinuni#0 Btw y'all I'm at work all day, I'll still respond on discord it just won't be as frequent
estiqt#0 and potentially mexico
estiqt#0 jefferson will now have to deal with euphoria
estiqt#0 the basin union joined jefferson, making it a meganation
sayerqt#0 and their most populate city
DaCorgoKing#3318 Vortex has a brain and doesn't seem to have a burning hatred for us
sayerqt#0 and took washington
sayerqt#0 within the first few days he declared war on us and we rolled them in 6 hours
sayerqt#0 his reign as king of oregon was so fucking funny
DaCorgoKing#3318 though he still is one of the biggest haters of cascadia
DaCorgoKing#3318 lol true
sayerqt#0 Pico's been rolled by Cascadia before idk if he can handle it again
DaCorgoKing#3318 I mean that's the worst I can think of that's actually likely staying
DaCorgoKing#3318 maybe pico?
DaCorgoKing#3318 idk but it's prob not anybody too bad
sayerqt#0 Anyone know who the candidates are in the RMF race
sayerqt#0 true
sayerqt#0 also we should maybe rename it
estiqt#0 and will be counteracted by the purchase of walla walla
estiqt#0 this damage will be minimal
estiqt#0 however
estiqt#0 we will likely lose a medium-sized town or two within the next week
estiqt#0 #1
estiqt#0 alright anyways, couple things i wanna say
DaCorgoKing#3318 vortex is at the very least more moderate, we could probably coexist with the RMF if things go well for him
milgorn123#0 He‚Äôs been friendly with me
milgorn123#0 That‚Äôs better
.starved#0 in rmf
.starved#0 killervortex said he wanted to run for leader
.starved#0 in other news
estiqt#0 death
aghastblock#0 ?
estiqt#0 guess who FUCKING CALLED IT LMAOOOOOO
estiqt#0 also
estiqt#0 i agree
estiqt#0 500g
.bachinuni#0 he logged off before i msgd back
milgorn123#0 Like let's get this bought
wrestlingwithgod#0 the band splits up for good
milgorn123#0 How's it going btw
wrestlingwithgod#0 Hope billowy quits honestly
.bachinuni#0 way more managable than billowy
.bachinuni#0 true
milgorn123#0 If pico becomes leader of the RMF this is an all around W
.bachinuni#0 yeah i agree
wrestlingwithgod#0 <@745807502351794186>  as your treasurer i evaluate no more than 500g from the n bank should be used on this purchase
milgorn123#0 I'd say 500G
milgorn123#0 For like
milgorn123#0 <@745807502351794186> We should definitely but this
milgorn123#0 Ignore "Poenix"
wrestlingwithgod#0 that would take a lot of gold
milgorn123#0 the question is who and the answer is jo star
wrestlingwithgod#0 but we dont really have the man power to hold it unless <@841159381495578674> can pull a resident or we can try to combine seaside and oceanside
milgorn123#0 That is so based
wrestlingwithgod#0 idk i wouldnt pay more than like 500g honestly
.bachinuni#0 and were talking about finding someone new
.bachinuni#0 my guess is he might be trying to move to banff to become the next rmf leader since 8set and mudkip are moving
wrestlingwithgod#0 XD

wrestlingwithgod#0 Ok my GF is holding Montana so Im back in Chaeronea as mayor. Ive acquired michoacan and renamed it to Montana
sayerqt#0 yeah sure

wrestlingwithgod#0 Don‚Äôt worry having a gf is something most emc players lack so understandable you didn‚Äôt know
estiqt#0 ik about krackkocaine but i didn't know your gf was there
estiqt#0 well yea ik

wrestlingwithgod#0 Frontier towns are fine at least the bigger ones. Sheridan and jacksonhole I don‚Äôt get to talk to much and Helena is being held by Bach

estiqt#0 yeah uh
wrestlingwithgod#0 As I make a new town üíÄ
milgorn123#0 ‚úÖ
estiqt#0 honestly the only city that is reliably safe is probably chaeronea rn
estiqt#0 we have expanded way too much
estiqt#0 we don't have the people necessary to hold more towns rn
estiqt#0 imma be real
estiqt#0 and like
estiqt#0 idk
estiqt#0 smth liek that
estiqt#0 "i understand that you've sunk a lot of money into this, and since it was your IRL friend who remade the city in the first place, it's only fair that the city goes to jefferson - however, the city is still a part of cascadia's core territory, so we hope it will eventually be transferred or sold back to cascadia in the future"
milgorn123#0 Skill issue
.bachinuni#0 bruh idk why but i cant search with From: in discord anymore
milgorn123#0 Also consider this
estiqt#0 here, say something like this
milgorn123#0 Yeah
estiqt#0 as it's always been ours
estiqt#0 we are putting umatilla firmly in our territory

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1130310621167091712/1134266678256087120/IMG_2439.pngestiqt#0 however in the future border agreement
estiqt#0 i mean, yeah, since it wasn't us who made the town in the first place, there's not much we can really do
estiqt#0 alright
estiqt#0 i see
estiqt#0 right
estiqt#0 ah
estiqt#0 alright well, while i obviously understand forest's want to have it join jefferson i can't help but be concerned because it's been a cascadian city for quite a while

.bachinuni#0 esti ur just mad because chatgpt did it faster than you could
.bachinuni#0 i just put ur prompt into chatgpt
.bachinuni#0 idk if this is true
milgorn123#0 Thanks
milgorn123#0 *bet
milgorn123#0 Hey
.bachinuni#0 Brewing Ingredients: Add Blaze Powder as fuel to the brewing stand. Put water bottles in the brewing stand to turn them into awkward potions.

Add Potion Ingredients: Add the primary ingredient (e.g., Nether Wart for awkward potions) and the secondary ingredient (e.g., a Ghast Tear for Potion of Healing). Some potions might require extended or stronger versions, which require different ingredients.

Collect Potions: Once the brewing process is complete, you'll have potions ready to use.

3. **Enchantment Books:**
Enchantment books allow you to apply specific enchantments to your gear using an anvil. Here's how you can obtain them:

Enchanting Table: Enchanting tables offer random enchantments on books. Surround the enchanting table with bookshelves (up to 15) to increase the enchantment levels.

Fishing: You can fish in Minecraft to obtain enchanted books directly as a rare loot drop.

Trading with Villagers: Some librarian villagers offer enchanted books as part of their trades. Find a librarian villager and unlock their enchanted book trade by using a lectern.

Exploring Strongholds: In stronghold libraries, you may find chests containing enchanted books.

Enchanting Books with Anvils: Combine enchanted books on an anvil to create more powerful combinations.
.bachinuni#0 1. **God Gear:**
"God gear" usually refers to the best possible armor and weapons with the best enchantments. To obtain god gear, you'll need to do the following:

Obtain Resources: Gather the necessary resources to craft the gear. For example, you'll need diamonds for diamond armor and weapons, or netherite ingots if you want to upgrade your gear to netherite (a stronger material found in the Nether dimension).

Enchanting Armor and Weapons: Enchant your gear at an enchantment table. To get the best enchantments, you'll need to have experience levels and bookshelves set up around the enchantment table to increase its power. Enchant multiple pieces of gear until you get the desired enchantments. For armor, popular enchantments include Protection, Unbreaking, Mending, and specific enchantments like Feather Falling, Respiration, etc. For weapons, prioritize enchantments like Sharpness, Sweeping Edge, Unbreaking, and Mending.

Anvil Combining: Use an anvil to combine enchanted books with your gear to stack enchantments or refresh their durability with Mending. You can also use the grindstone to remove unwanted enchantments.

Potions and Enchanted Golden Apples: For additional buffs, brew potions like Strength, Regeneration, Fire Resistance, and more. Enchanted Golden Apples (Notch Apples) can provide extremely strong buffs.

2. **Potions:**
Potions in Minecraft can provide various beneficial effects when consumed. Here's how you can make them:

Gather Resources: You'll need glass bottles, water, and the materials for the specific potion you want to create. For example, to make a Potion of Healing, you'll need Blaze Powder (from Blaze Rods) and Nether Wart.

Brewing Stand: Craft a Brewing Stand using Blaze Rods and Cobblestone. Place it down, and right-click to access its interface.
milgorn123#0 Uuuughhhhh fiiiiine

milgorn123#0 <@301126967992909855> Can you do me a favor and write three things? Just step by step instructions on how to make god gear, potions, and enchantment books

estiqt#0 tell him to log on and do /t toggle open and set it to closed because the RMF is trying to snipe it
estiqt#0 it will be reenabled shortly
estiqt#0 for scheduled maintenance
milgorn123#0 Oh right
estiqt#0 the 42 day bot was disabled temporarily
milgorn123#0 We should add it to the 42 day bot
estiqt#0 well
estiqt#0 k
milgorn123#0 I know
milgorn123#0 Last time it was close to falling forest got him to log on within the hour
estiqt#0 last online june 21
milgorn123#0 I‚Äôll talk to him again
estiqt#0 what are you talking about
estiqt#0 the town falls in like a day or two
milgorn123#0 I talked to him last time
milgorn123#0 It‚Äôs forests best friend
milgorn123#0 I think
estiqt#0 what the fuck doy ou mean it's safe
milgorn123#0 No it‚Äôs safe
estiqt#0 1 from jefferson, 1 from the RMF
estiqt#0 2 other people are in it now
estiqt#0 since the town is open
estiqt#0 anyways
estiqt#0 milgorn said he could half a month ago
estiqt#0 can someone see if we can contact martogamer at all
estiqt#0 anyways <@&1001007207116193922> we must be prepared to lose umatilla
estiqt#0 we have no treaty agreements as far as i know
wrestlingwithgod#0 He is friendly breaking treaty agreements and has pouched two towns on our coast after assuring when they left they would expand north as we would expand south
estiqt#0 he is one of the more pro-cascadian people and he leads the nation
estiqt#0 42forest is very friendly towards us
estiqt#0 listen, i‚Äôm dealing with jefferson, dw about it
estiqt#0 oml what are y‚Äôall doing üíÄüíÄüíÄ
DaCorgoKing#3318 yeah, nvm on that, Forest has already hated cascadia once before
wrestlingwithgod#0 Regardless if he was cordial he has been plainly poaching towns and if RMF is less of a concern maybe we should turn around and have a good conversation with our so called ‚Äúallies‚Äù Jefferson
wrestlingwithgod#0 Milgorn was very concerned once they took all our southern coastline we had already agreed was well within our border agreement
DaCorgoKing#3318 ik milgorn is often talking to the guy, and he isn't concerned, so I'm not too worried about it
DaCorgoKing#3318 idk lol
deadatnoon#0 Aren‚Äôt they breaking contracts though?
DaCorgoKing#3318 like, ik forest is a nice guy and all
DaCorgoKing#3318 though I am a little suspicious of the fact that we've lost all of our coastal towns in the south
DaCorgoKing#3318 random stuff like that wont damage relations with them
DaCorgoKing#3318 yeah dont worry about hershey lol
deadatnoon#0 I also got kicked from Jefferson‚Äôs discord for critiquing their builds
deadatnoon#0 I‚Äôd also like to talk about Jefferson and our relationship with them. If you didn‚Äôt know yesterday, Hershey tried to wage war with them in the world chat, who‚Äôs one of our citizens.
deadatnoon#0 Thanks for letting me know
deadatnoon#0 That‚Äôs nuts
DaCorgoKing#3318 or just people that jump on the hate bandwagon
DaCorgoKing#3318 they are often assholes
DaCorgoKing#3318 that's the thing with a lot of people that hate cascadia
DaCorgoKing#3318 though he's not very well liked by the wider emc community, he faked a staff member's death and apparently it caused the poor guy a panic attack
deadatnoon#0 I see
DaCorgoKing#3318 he was the guy that took over the northern part of oceanside and gave it to the rmf
DaCorgoKing#3318 Though, North Paso has definitely tried pretty hard to antagonize us
DaCorgoKing#3318 since Cascadia is a big consumer economy
DaCorgoKing#3318 only reason I can see an enemy actually being a threat is if they were a big shop
DaCorgoKing#3318 they dont really have a really big economy
deadatnoon#0 Yep, I learned from experience
deadatnoon#0 Texas is the only nation I can think of that opposes us with an actual economy
DaCorgoKing#3318 most of the residents are actually super friendly, it's just the leader North_Paso who is a genuine asshole
DaCorgoKing#3318 Oh, we also have Texas that opposes us
DaCorgoKing#3318 rmf always brings goons with them, typically from indochina
deadatnoon#0 Yeah I‚Äôve only seen them team up with RMF at Osoyoos once
DaCorgoKing#3318 but we never even see any of their hunters come over
DaCorgoKing#3318 I think we are *technically* at "war" with Kushan
DaCorgoKing#3318 yes, but those nations are constantly warring anyway
deadatnoon#0 But there‚Äôs a difference between hating us and actually opposing us
deadatnoon#0 Wei as well
DaCorgoKing#3318 Kushan hates us, for example
DaCorgoKing#3318 like
DaCorgoKing#3318 good point
deadatnoon#0 But don‚Äôt pvp nations sort of hate everyone
DaCorgoKing#3318 (or anybody that hates gays lmao)
DaCorgoKing#3318 Well there is a lot of anti-cascadia rhetoric, mostly from pvp nations
DaCorgoKing#3318 They harassed a bunch of towns(boohoo, just stay in claims), stole a couple towns(not good but whatever), and probably affected our world relations(?)
deadatnoon#0 Oh and Indochina ig
deadatnoon#0 Most nations like us. The only people who I can think of that are enemies atm is maybe Jefferson
DaCorgoKing#3318 They never really did
DaCorgoKing#3318 I think that the residents will just eventually just stop caring about cascadia, we already have people there that actually kinda like us
deadatnoon#0 Also I don‚Äôt think RMF would pose any sort of threat anymore. The worst I can think of is them harassing our allies
DaCorgoKing#3318 I mean, 8set and Mudkip are 2 of the biggest warmongerers in the nation, I can only think of Billowy, Fire_344, and like a couple others that are still warring
deadatnoon#0 I got kicked from the Jefferson discord server üíÄ
milgorn123#0 Anyways let‚Äôs never learn anything from this and proceed as normal
milgorn123#0 That we just had to wait them out
milgorn123#0 Also can I just say that Esti was right all along
milgorn123#0 It could also be given to a dumbass like pico which would be a W
milgorn123#0 2 is most likely which is a gamble, since it could easily be given to someone more intelligent and liked than the current leaders who can actually do war
milgorn123#0 <@&1001007207116193922> There are four ways this new development with the RMF can go:

1. They just don‚Äôt and keep staying in the RMF (unlikely, 8set said he was bored of North America later when he briefly joined nation chat after selling Utah, and on their discord they sent the attached message)

2. They move and give their nation to a trusted friend, like pico or someone else. Unfortunately this is likely, and it‚Äôs a gamble depending on who takes control.

3. They sell it to a random who takes control: we can probably be friendly with them

4. One of them stays behind to lead, and still does stuff.
milgorn123#0 8set already made a town there
wrestlingwithgod#0 I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs below n spawn besides the icerails and personal plots mixed with various underground rooms
.starved#0 idk a lot of ways we could go about it, i could give you a list of farms I would like to build and you can yes and no them, or I could map them out beforehand and show you roughly where they'd be
.starved#0 <@519281851441872906> what do you want from me to give me n spawn perms and permissions to build automatic farms
.starved#0 so maybe theyll just chill
.starved#0 8set said he was "retiring"
.starved#0 i think
.starved#0 fair
sayerqt#0 closer to papua new guinea
sayerqt#0 its not on australia though
.starved#0 limpopo will defend the local australians tho fr
.starved#0 australia seems really chill so depending on how they treat the locals there it may be very sad
.starved#0 geniunely kinda sad theyre setting up in australia
ravioli983#0 hmm
.bachinuni#0 they also said they would genuinely sell RMF for 15k
.bachinuni#0 so the war might be ending depending on who they find
.bachinuni#0 they were also talking about finding someone to run the RMF
.bachinuni#0 its all the way over in australia
.bachinuni#0

DaCorgoKing#3318 honestly I hope it's true

ravioli983#0 soon my fellow cascadians
ravioli983#0 mb
ravioli983#0 ok its been deleted
ravioli983#0 oop
estiqt#0 in general chat
estiqt#0 <@841159381495578674> and don't answer that question
estiqt#0 that's not a question you should ask in general
estiqt#0 <@898022672317964308>
estiqt#0 i see
wrestlingwithgod#0 guess
wrestlingwithgod#0 who made the ticket i fuess
DaCorgoKing#3318 also there was not a single stop on this line and it didn't go anywhere useful, it was literally a waste of ice
DaCorgoKing#3318 no idea, but it apparently was planned to go to wyoming, perhaps Falcoeur?
estiqt#0 who did?
milgorn123#0 any time works
.bachinuni#0 Yo also <@841159381495578674> what dates did you want to do the recruiting event?
DaCorgoKing#3318 not because of maximum warns
DaCorgoKing#3318 I just got a 3 day ban because of the icerail
DaCorgoKing#3318 you are only able to appeal warns if it's at the maximum(5)
.bachinuni#0 cringe
DaCorgoKing#3318 Billowy was able to appeal his warn because it was at maximum
.bachinuni#0 and got it removed
.bachinuni#0 thats BS because billowy appealed their warn
wrestlingwithgod#0 Hm okay
DaCorgoKing#3318 Well I technically didn't make the icerail, and either way they apparently dont let you appeal warns
sayerqt#0 because building
sayerqt#0 honestly if a department does it it should be interior
.bachinuni#0 Yeah imma just host it
wrestlingwithgod#0 So your gonna host the contest? Cause yapan is gone or you having the new sec of social services
.bachinuni#0 also tho since its just a 1 day thing it can wait untill after the recruitment contest
.bachinuni#0 it got pushed back a bit tho cause yapan kinda just left
.bachinuni#0 before milgorn talked about the recruiting contest
.bachinuni#0 I had announced the building contest awhile ago
wrestlingwithgod#0 Building contest? I thought we were doing a recruiting contest.
milgorn123#0 Sure looks good Bach
wrestlingwithgod#0 Like no way can something you build and take down can be considered a grief right
wrestlingwithgod#0 Did you show them that you made the icerail?
.bachinuni#0 how do yall feel about these prizes for the building contest?
1st - 35g
2nd - 20g
3rd - 15g
ravioli983#0 No worries
.bachinuni#0 sorry i was missing yesterday, I had a long work day and went straight to bed afterwards
ravioli983#0 Also wheres bach
ravioli983#0 Real
sayerqt#0 Billowysplash moment
DaCorgoKing#3318 I could say some of the nastiest words I can think of in chat and get a measly warn
sayerqt#0 lmao
DaCorgoKing#3318 Yeah turns out I literally got a 3 day long ban for demolishing a completely unused icerail
DaCorgoKing#3318 yeah it literally ends in a couple hours
ravioli983#0 only temp
DaCorgoKing#3318 real
estiqt#0 hm
estiqt#0 okay
estiqt#0 ohhh
estiqt#0 why
estiqt#0 wat
wrestlingwithgod#0 They banned corgo
estiqt#0 who
DaCorgoKing#3318 no natives to slaughter tho
DaCorgoKing#3318 fr
.starved#0 i believe in manifesting our destiny fr
DaCorgoKing#3318 luckily the whole ban started while I wasnt here, I didn't even know about it until this morning
DaCorgoKing#3318 yeah they never specified coords, I'd have to check tommorow since I'll get unbanned at like 5am
wrestlingwithgod#0 Probably can get that one removed
DaCorgoKing#3318 since the lengths sorta line up
DaCorgoKing#3318 I am thinking that it's for a demolition of an unused icerail line that I did back in like April, considering that it's "Iceway Grief > 1000 bs"
wrestlingwithgod#0 Bruh
DaCorgoKing#3318 Tempban, I'm not exactly sure what's going on
wrestlingwithgod#0 <@1044845201149153381> you actually banned?
milgorn123#0 This is our claim map is it fine if we send it to the house or not to oficial codify into law? <@&1001007207116193922>
milgorn123#0 What are we going to do about jefferson
.starved#0 ive fallen victim to the propaganda
.starved#0 but those papal state propaganda videos go hard
.starved#0 a bit based
.starved#0 a bit
sayerqt#0 Did I hear, based??
.starved#0 in their town
.starved#0 they have the cult of flesh
sayerqt#0 Based?
.starved#0 so thats neat
.starved#0 theyre cultists too
estiqt#0 make sure their town doesn‚Äôt fall
estiqt#0 üëç
sayerqt#0 just inactive
sayerqt#0 they're good with us and pals
sayerqt#0 they're just really inactive
estiqt#0 yea i saw that
sayerqt#0 but they're mostly inactive
sayerqt#0 like we have a diplomatic gc
sayerqt#0 not really
estiqt#0 anything else?
estiqt#0 like
estiqt#0 i heard we're chill with them and they used to be cascadian but
estiqt#0 also, what exactly is our relationship with Omineca?
estiqt#0 nvm it's been here since at least a weeek ago
estiqt#0 is wendover a new RMF town
sayerqt#0 i'm aware lol
sayerqt#0 yeah ik
wrestlingwithgod#0 This is the current vote for the judge nomination
wrestlingwithgod#0 https://discord.com/channels/966171948520464444/1008179486430339074/1133237958749737080
deadatnoon#0 Gotcha
sayerqt#0 but just keep in mind that bach already chose someone for the current seat so this would prob be for justice in training or if his nominee fails
sayerqt#0 <@981681211988652123> You can apply just by dming bach that‚Äôs how it was done before
sayerqt#0 I mean yeah
wrestlingwithgod#0 I guess depends if it passes in the house‚Ä¶ but Bach can just renominate xbest again
sayerqt#0 But he already chose
sayerqt#0 I mean he can
wrestlingwithgod#0 I didn‚Äôt know that Bach couldn‚Äôt just look at another application‚Ä¶ not like judge applications are written into a law
sayerqt#0 You can apply for the justice-in-training when it's proposed and passes
sayerqt#0 But the application phase for this seat is already over
sayerqt#0 So we aren't appointing inexperienced judges directly to the court w/out training
sayerqt#0 Bach has expressed potential interest in nominating you for the Justice-in-Training role when he implements and proposes the Judicial Reform
sayerqt#0 6 people applied, and Bach chose the person he thought was best for the job
sayerqt#0 Like applications were open for 8 days
sayerqt#0 The position was already nominated
deadatnoon#0 Ayo, this is off topic, but where do I go to apply to be a judge?
sayerqt#0 and instead have yellowknife and some of those towns in the mountains that we actually have
sayerqt#0 I personally think we should not have like the main parts of alberta
sayerqt#0 i‚Äôll ask penguin first
